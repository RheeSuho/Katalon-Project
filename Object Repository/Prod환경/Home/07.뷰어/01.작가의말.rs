      <value>You guys are incredible.

Just a few weeks ago the Inkies Awards were announced, but I’m not much of a competitor, so I didn’t even consider putting my comic forward haha.

But then I got an email from Tapas telling me that The Boy &amp; the Wolf was among the top 10 finalists. And I thought &quot;Wow. My readers alone got The Boy &amp; the Wolf nominated, without me saying a word.&quot; I was genuinely so moved, impressed, and grateful.
And then it happened a second time. You made it again, you made this comic win the  Favorite Community Comic award.

I can’t even describe the overwhelming feeling of love and support I felt at that moment. It’s not about winning—it’s about realizing just how much this comic means to you. 
And that means everything to me.

When I started The Boy and the Wolf, I had no idea where this would all lead me. I was just drawing on my own, creating something deeply personal. I genuinely didn't think a BL  with a shonen style, yet so centered on emotional nuances, subtle attentions and relationships would find its audience. Every time, I asked myself, 'Will people understand and feel what I’m trying to convey here with this character?&quot;
And you did. And it blows me away. 

You all have your own way of reading this comic, from the casual read on the subway, enjoying how messy those boys can be; to the more passionate ones sending me pages of analysis and theories -which is just so rewarding for me. I like to know that you see meaning in things I put there with care. In the quiet scenes and in the unspoken words.
No matter how you read it, I thank you for connecting with these characters. I will take the utmost care of them, I promise.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for believing in this story. Thank you for caring. For being so dedicated, for all the support, and for the love.

See you soon &lt;3
